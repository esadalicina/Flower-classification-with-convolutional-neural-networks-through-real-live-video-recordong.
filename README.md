1 Python program with two code files

PROJECT:

This project is about flower classification with convolutional neural networks.
Where I descripe the scientific and technical part of the project.

USE:

If you are new in this topic and you want to know details about 
the project then you need to read the final report.

At first read one of the reports or look at the videos, it depends how many you know 
about this topic.

Then you can start to look over the code and run it.
There are two files, one to build the model and the other to make the videocapture.

When you run the second file, you can click on the 's' button on the keyboard to start the classification.
To stop the classification you can click on the 'f' button.

When you want to stop the whole program, you can click on the 'q' button
and sometime you need to click more then one time on the 'q' to stop it.
